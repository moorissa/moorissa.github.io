# hey there, i'm moorissa üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
## about ‚ú®
A robotics engineer and artist based in San Francisco, California. I enjoy innovating and creating, building autonomous systems, and solving highly complex technical problems. Since I was a kid, I've also been drawn to the world of creative arts, like painting and writing. You can find my  [artwork here](https://instagram.com/moorissatjokro) and my [blog here](https://moorissa.medium.com/).

## currently ü¶æ
I work as a Senior Software Systems Engineer at [Cruise](https://www.getcruise.com/), a robotaxi startup currently developing an L4 autonomy. I want to help push the boundaries of AI and robotics towards the world's first L5 technology, as I believe it's a fundamental change to a much safer and more sustainable earth for all.

I was previously at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) for nearly 4 years, where I helped the Autopilot team launch its first [Full Self-Driving (FSD)](https://www.tesla.com/support/autopilot) feature. Prior to that, I worked as a machine learning researcher at [NASA Goddard Institute](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/) on [climate change models](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/modelE/) and the [United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/) on supply chain optimizations for [reducing malnutritions](https://www.wfp.org/specialized-nutritious-food) in Subsaharan Africa.

## engineering üöÄ
I completed an M.S. in Data Science with a focus on Machine Learning at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), and a B.S. in Industrial and Systems Engineering and Statistics (summa cum laude) from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) at 19. During sophomore year, I fell in love with statistical learning theory taught by Dr. Nicoleta Serban and subsequently took a few PhD engineering courses in that domain.

My fascination towards robotics and embodied artificial intelligence didn't truly develop until Tesla, when I started working on the firmware UI, closed-loop simulations, and algorithmic state machines, and got to collaborate with the strongest engineers I'd ever worked with. Maybe they're right when they say curiosity killed the cat--naivet√© too actually--but satisfaction somehow always brought it back to life. So there goes my top rule for a fulfilling life: _Follow your curiosity_ :).

## stay in touch üíå
When I'm not creating, I love learning about cultures and philosophies around the world--whether through local communities, volunteering, or living abroad temporarily. Among 23 countries I've been to, I thoroughly enjoyed the adventure of living in France, Brazil, and South Africa for a couple months. I hope I don't just get to see the world, but to also connect with others in different corners of the globe.

So, please connect with me! I speak English, Indonesian, Javanese, and very little French, but highly proficient in Google Translate and ChatGPT lol. Feel free to write me a note via [email](mailto:moorissa.maura@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moorissa/).
