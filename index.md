# hey there, i'm moorissa üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
## about ‚ú®
A robotics engineer and a fine artist based in San Francisco, California. I enjoy innovating and creating, building self-driving software, and solving highly complex technical problems. Since I was a kid, I've also been drawn to the world of creative arts, like painting and writing. You can find my  [artwork here](https://instagram.com/moorissatjokro) and my [blog here](https://moorissa.medium.com/).

## currently ü¶æ
I work as a Senior Software Systems Engineer at [Cruise](https://www.getcruise.com/), a robotaxi startup currently developing an L4 autonomy systems. I want to help push the boundaries of AI and robotics towards the world's first L5 technology, as I believe it's a fundamental change to a much safer and more sustainable earth, for all.

I was previously at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) for nearly 4 years, where I helped the Autopilot team launch [Full Self-Driving feature](https://www.tesla.com/support/autopilot) (FSD-beta) back in 2020. Prior to that, I worked as a machine learning researcher at [NASA](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/) working on climate change models and the [United Nations](https://www.wfp.org/) on supply chain optimizations for reducing malnutritions in Subsaharan Africa.

## engineering üöÄ
I completed an M.S. in Data Science at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), with a focus on Machine Learning, and a B.S. in Industrial and Systems Engineering and Statistics from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) (summa cum laude) at 19, where I secretly took PhD engineering courses and fell in love with statistical learning theory.

I guess they're right when they say curiosity killed the cat--naivet√© too actually--but satisfaction somehow always brought it back to life. So there goes my top rule for a fulfilling life: "Follow your curiosity" :).

## stay in touch üíå
When I'm not creating, I love learning about different cultures and philosophies around the world. Whether it is through communities, volunteering, or living in another country temporarily. Among 23 countries traversed, I had thoroughly enjoyed adventuring life like a local in France, Brazil, and South Africa for a couple months. I hope I don't just get to see the world, but to also connect with those in different corners of the globe.

So, connect with me! I speak English, Indonesian, Javanese, and very little French, but highly proficient in Google Translate. Feel free to write me a note via [email](mailto:moorissa.maura@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moorissa/)!

Take care and keep slaying!
